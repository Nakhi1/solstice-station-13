	description = "While nowhere near as spiritual or superstitious as, for example, Christians may be, neither are the Khazan devoid of spiritual beliefs. Most Khazan believe \
	that their forbears watch over them from on high, and when a Khazan experiences a sensation they cannot explain away as being caused by something physical, they liken it to \
	being the touch of an ancestral spirit, and have to determine based on the sensation what the message might be. Many Khazan also believe that while it is important to \
	remember the legacy of one’s ancestors, it is also important to leave a legacy of one’s own, bringing something new to their clan to be remembered for.<br><br>Each family \
	within a clan has a tomb in which their ancestors are buried. A likeness of the individual is sculpted of stone and placed atop the chamber containing the sarcophagus, and \
	it holds a stone tablet with their eulogy chiseled into it. No clan will ride over or build upon the terrain a funeral cairn lies within, out of respect for the dead and \
	to avoid obstructing the way from the earth to the heavens."
